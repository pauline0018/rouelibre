    This dissertation, entitled "HTTP://ROUELIBRE.CLICK", explores the forms of the "Leach Pottery Wheel", an artisanal pottery machine tool used by Bernard Leach at Leach Pottery in St Ives, England from 1940. The analysis focuses on the shape of the object, using mainly open-access resources. It develops an iconographic corpus to understand the sensitive mechanism through a variety of sources, from archives to contemporary forums. This approach enables us to study the prolific representations of this machine tool, looking at the relationships between creators, their tools and their environment, and highlighting the way in which traditional pottery skills intermingle with the creativity of contemporary 'makers'. Part of the research focuses on the use of scale models to capture the structure of the Leach Pottery Wheel. This hybrid approach, combining traditional methods and digital tools, opens up prospects for technological autonomy in pottery, combining craft and programming.
